# Habit Enforcer

Habit Enforcer is a simple focus tool that allows the user to store a list of habits they wish to focus on and while the program is running. This was designed for personal use so the programs the app detects as distractions are currently hard coded as my distractions. I plan to make allow the user to specify their own distractions in future builds. 

## Apps Blocked
- Steam
- Discord
- Battle.net
- World of Warcraft
- MS Paint
- Minecraft

## Roadmap
I plan to make this a full windows application rather than just a simple console app. As mentioned previously the user will also be able to edit the list of distractions.

## Installation
Users can find the .exe file in Habit_Enforcer/bin/Release/net8.0/win-x64/Habit_Enforcer.exe.
